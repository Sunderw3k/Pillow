## About The Project

*DreamBot costs a lot.*

At least for me. If I can use my programming skills to get it for free, that's great. The client is free with paid VIP features, but they are just locked behind an account status, which can be spoofed. Even just on the client-side with some byte code patching.

Their script trial makes me able to get my hands on the script jar. That's not good security. After sniffing and downloading the jars, I can put them up on my own server implementation, and even set the trial duration to... owned.

A lot of the code that scripts use to verify whether you actually own their script can also be bypassed (as seen in the hooks to `ScriptManager`).

One thing i find funny is that the packets **MIGHT** be stored as obfuscated on their server side, due to **ALL OF THEM** being valid java class names, whereas the rest get obfuscated to start with a digit.
## Getting Started

Running the client doesn't require anything, just make an account on their [website](https://dreambot.org/) and try out some scripts, replace the username/password in [the client handler](https://github.com/Sunderw3k/Pillow/blob/master/client/src/main/kotlin/rip/sunrise/client/ClientHandler.kt) to your account's info.

When you run the client revision.txt will be automatically downloaded into a new folder n the current directory called `output`. That contains everything necessary for the server setup.

For the server part - make a file `config.json` for the server config, yes the filename is important.

```json
{
	"revisionFile": "revision.txt",
	"scriptConfigDir": "configs/",
	"serverUrl": "http://localhost:6666/"
}
```

Replace `serverUrl` in case you want to use your own webserver, obviously.

The config directory contains config files, also autogenerated by the client. They contain metadata about the script, you can probably guess how that works.

The `options/_.txt` files are also generated, not sure what they're trying to protect by doing that.
## Usage

Get the DreamBot client jar from their website. Then run

```
java -javaagent:/path/to/agent.jar -jar /path/to/dreambot.jar
```

If everything works, you should be connected and get the SPONSOR role. There are logs on the server, so take a look at that in case issues emerge.
